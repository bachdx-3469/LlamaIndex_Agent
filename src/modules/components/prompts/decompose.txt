Passage:
Employees are allowed to take Company equipment off Company premises in certain circumstances and with proper authorization. Generally, they are permitted to take Company equipment off-site when it is necessary to perform their job duties or fulfill work-related responsibilities. This may include situations where employees need to attend client meetings, conferences, or other business-related events outside of the office. In such cases, employees are expected to use the Company equipment responsibly and ensure its safekeeping. Prior approval from the relevant supervisor or department head is typically required before taking any Company equipment off-site. Additionally, they may be required to sign an agreement or adhere to specific guidelines regarding the use and protection of the equipment while off-premises.
